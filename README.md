Animations of robotic arm using usdview
The aim of this assignment is to create an animation for the robotic arm 
The hierarchy is structured in the following way: robot -> base -> lower arm -> upper arm -> gripper (parent to child) so that any animation on a componenet, leads to the same animation on its child components
The animations include : 
Base rotation which rotates the lower arm  around the base for 360 degrees over 192 frames
upper arm twist which rotates the the upper arm for 30 degrees along 96 frames
gripper scaler which increases the scale of the gripper to 2 and back to its original size in 192 frames
